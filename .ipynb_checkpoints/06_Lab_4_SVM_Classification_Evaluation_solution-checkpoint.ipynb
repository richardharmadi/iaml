Do the regression coefficients make sense given that class 1 is spam? *Hint: Consider the sigmoid function and how it transforms values into a probability between 0 and 1. Since our attributes are boolean, a positive coefficient can only increase the total sum fed through the sigmoid and thus move the output of the sigmoid towards 1.

Try `5`, `10`, `50`, `100`, `200`, `500`, `1000`, `1500` and `2000` and test the classifier on the test set.

    "For instance, think of the situation where you have a single test point and two classifiers. Both classifiers predict the label correctly, however classifier A predicts tha the test point belongs to the class with probability 0.55, whereas classifier B predicts the correct class with probability 0.99. Classification accuracy would be the same for the two classifiers (why?) but the `log_loss`  metric would indicate that classifier B should be favoured.\n",
